 * Manages the various controllers connected to the computer. Individual
 * controllers are identified by their product id, and the class corresponding
 * to the controller is instantiated. Following, controllers can be assigned to
 * specific roles in relation to the rover. For example, one controller can be
 * responsible for providing the driving direction to the rover. Assignment of
 * controller roles is automatic, with the most important capabilities assigned
 * to the controllers with the highest priority.
 *
 * Once controllers are connected and assigned, an event loop can query for
 * changes in controller state. If the change is mapped to an action, the
 * class will trigger a packet transmission to the rover. For example, moving
 * the driving axis on the controller responsible for rover driving will cause
 * a packet transmission to the rover containing the motor power requested by
 * the user.
 *
 * Since this class is a subclass of QThread, the event loop as well as any
 * necessary setup can be invoked by calling the run() method. Likewise, calling
 * the quit() slot will exit the event loop.
